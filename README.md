## Database Design
To ensure the Airbnb clone is functional and scalable, we will implement a relational database with the following key entities:

1. **Users**
This entity stores information about the users of the application, including guests and property owners.

- **id**: A unique identifier for each user.

- **username**: A unique name used for login.

- **email**: The user's email address, also used for authentication.

- **password_hash**: A secure hash of the user's password.

- **created_at**: The timestamp when the user account was created.

2. **Properties**
This entity represents the accommodations that are available for booking.

- **id**: A unique identifier for each property.

- **title**: The name or title of the property (e.g., "Cozy Downtown Apartment").

- **description**: A detailed description of the property.

- **price_per_night**: The cost to book the property for one night.

- **location**: The address or location of the property.

- **owner_id**: A foreign key linking to the Users entity, representing the owner of the property.

3. **Bookings**
This entity tracks the reservations made by users for specific properties.

- **id**: A unique identifier for each booking.

- **user_id**: A foreign key linking to the Users entity, representing the guest who made the booking.

- **property_id**: A foreign key linking to the Properties entity, representing the booked property.

- **check_in_date**: The date when the booking starts.

- **check_out_date**: The date when the booking ends.

- **total_price**: The total cost of the booking.

4. **Reviews**
This entity stores feedback and ratings provided by users after a stay.

- **id**: A unique identifier for each review.

- **booking_id**: A foreign key linking to the Bookings entity.

- **rating**: A numerical rating (e.g., 1 to 5).

- **comment**: The text of the review.

- **created_at**: The timestamp when the review was submitted.

5. **Payments**
This entity handles the transaction details for each booking.

- **id**: A unique identifier for each payment record.

- **booking_id**: A foreign key linking to the Bookings entity.

- **amount**: The amount of the payment.

- **status**: The current status of the payment (e.g., "pending," "completed," "failed").

- **transaction_id**: A unique ID from the payment gateway.

- **payment_date**: The timestamp when the payment was processed.

**Entity Relationships**
- Users and Properties: A *User* can be the owner of multiple *Properties*. This is a one-to-many relationship. The *owner_id* in the *Properties* table links to the *id* of the *Users* table.

- Users and Bookings: A *User* can create multiple *Bookings*. This is a one-to-many relationship. The *user_id* in the *Bookings* table links to the *id* of the *Users* table.

- Properties and Bookings: A *Property* can have multiple *Bookings*. This is a one-to-many relationship. The *property_id* in the *Bookings* table links to the *id* of the *Properties* table.

- Bookings and Reviews: A *Booking* can have at most one *Review*. This is a one-to-one relationship. The *booking_id* in the *Reviews* table links to the *id* of the *Bookings* table.

- Bookings and Payments: A *Booking* can have one or more *Payments* (e.g., a deposit and a final payment). For simplicity, we can treat this as a one-to-one relationship where a *Booking* has one *Payment*. The *booking_id* in the *Payments* table links to the *id* of the *Bookings* table.

## Feature Breakdown
This project is built around a set of core features that define the user experience and business logic of a booking platform. Each feature is designed to work together to provide a seamless, end-to-end service for both guests and property owners.

1. **User Management**
This feature handles all aspects of user authentication and profiles. It allows new users to register an account, log in securely, and manage their personal information. This is foundational to the application, as it enables users to become either a guest who can book properties or a host who can list them.

2. **Property Management**
This module empowers hosts to list, update, and manage their properties. It includes functionality for adding new property details, such as location, price, and descriptions, and for editing or removing existing listings. This feature is crucial for building the inventory of available accommodations on the platform.

3. **Booking System**
The booking system is the central component of the application's business logic. It allows guests to search for available properties, select check-in and check-out dates, and make a reservation. This feature manages the booking process, ensuring that property availability is accurately reflected and that a reservation is correctly created and associated with the user and property.

4. **Review and Rating System**
This feature allows guests to leave feedback on a property after their stay. Users can submit a rating and a written review, which helps future guests make informed decisions and provides valuable feedback to property owners. This system builds trust and transparency within the community, encouraging high-quality service from hosts.

5. **Payment Processing**
The payment processing feature handles secure transactions for all bookings. It integrates with a payment gateway to allow guests to pay for their reservations and ensures that the payment status is correctly recorded. This is a critical component for the financial integrity of the platform, as it manages the flow of funds between guests and hosts.

### API Security
Securing the backend APIs is critical for protecting user data, maintaining system integrity, and ensuring reliable transactions. For the Airbnb Clone Project, we'll implement several key security measures.

## Key Security Measures Implemented
- **Authentication**: This process verifies the identity of users and applications before they can access the API. We'll use JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), a standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. When a user logs in, the server will generate a JWT and send it to the client. The client will then include this token in the header of subsequent requests to authenticate itself.

- **Authorization**: This determines what an authenticated user is permitted to do. Once a user is authenticated, the API must check if they have the necessary permissions to perform a specific action, like updating their own listing but not someone else's. We'll implement role-based access control to define different user roles (e.g., guest, host, admin) and assign specific permissions to each role.

- **Rate Limiting**: This controls the number of API requests a user can make within a specific time frame. It is a crucial measure for preventing Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and misuse of the API. By setting limits on requests, we can protect our backend from being overwhelmed and ensure fair usage for all users.

## Importance of Security for Key Project Areas
Security is crucial for various aspects of the project to ensure a trustworthy and reliable platform.

- **Protecting User Data**: User data, including personal information and booking history, is highly sensitive. Implementing authentication and authorization is essential to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. If user data is compromised, it can lead to identity theft and a significant loss of user trust.
  
- **Securing Payments**: The platform will handle financial transactions for bookings. It's imperative to secure the payment process to prevent fraud and protect users' financial information. We will use a secure, third-party payment gateway that handles sensitive credit card data, ensuring we don't store this information on our servers. API security measures will ensure that payment requests are legitimate and that transaction details are not intercepted.

- **Maintaining System Integrity**: Without proper security, the API could be vulnerable to attacks that could corrupt data, alter listings, or disrupt service. Rate limiting and other security protocols help maintain the stability and integrity of the system by preventing malicious activities and ensuring the platform remains available and functional for all users.
